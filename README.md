# KeepInTouch

This application helps attendees at a conference keep in touch after the event.

It was created during the I TAKE unconference 2013 (http://itakeunconf.com) as an experiment in hourly deployment. See the blog post http://www.mozaicworks.com/blog/developing-and-releasing-every-hour/ for details.
