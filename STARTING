## If you never used grails before 

Don't worry, it's simple.

Grails is an MVC web framework very similar with ruby on rails. It uses a language called Groovy. Groovy is a JVM language, and you can safely write code using Java syntax. However, it allows you to write less code, so it's useful to learn its constructs.

* Install grails from http://www.grails.org/
* If you use eclipse, install grails support plugin
* IntelliJ Idea Community edition has support for groovy. The ultimate edition has support for grails.
* Alternatively, install Groovy/Grails Tool Suite: http://grails.org/products/ggts. It is a tool based on eclipse.
* Read the quick start: http://www.grails.org/doc/latest/guide/gettingStarted.html
